How to choose an AWS Region 

* Compliance with data and governance and legal requirements, like data never leaves the region without our explicit permission 
* Proximity to customer is going to reduce latency 
* Available Services with in the region 
* Pricing may varies one region to another region 

## AWS Availability Zones

 * Each region has many availability zones usually min is 3 max is 6 
 * Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more separate data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, but theyâ€™re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
* These AZ's Separated each other, so that each AZ's is isolated form natural calamities 

AZ name (eg. us-east-1a) is linked to an AWS account. Same AZ name for two AWS accounts might not refer to the same physical AZ. Use AZ ID (unique ID for each AZ) to coordinate AZ across accounts.
